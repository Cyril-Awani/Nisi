Hello Sir Oruese, Here's the quick Project Setup Instructions just in case

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

## 1. Install Dependencies

open your text editor terminal while in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Run the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.
